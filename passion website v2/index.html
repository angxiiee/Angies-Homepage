                    <span class="answer-text">
                        <br>When I was 15, I was able to get my first job. At first, I didn’t really know what to do with all the money I was making, so I ended up just saving it all. Eventually, I started going to the mall, and that’s when my addiction for shopping started. At first, I was too scared to buy anything, so I would just go into a bunch of stores and try on different clothing items. Eventually, I started purchasing clothes for myself, and evolved a new style that suited me better than before. Going to the mall slowly became a hobby of mine, and I found myself there at least once a week.</br>

                    <span class="answer-text">
                        <br>When I went away to college, unfortunately, going to the mall became quite difficult because there was no mall nearby. With my shopping addiction requiring a solution, I turned to a new way of shopping: online shopping. Online shopping soon became my new hobby in order to continue my addiction. Since then, I have now become addicted to both online shopping and regular shopping and so I barely have any money.</br>
